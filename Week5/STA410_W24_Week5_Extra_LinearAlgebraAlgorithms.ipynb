    "   > Students must work in accordance with the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019) (and see also http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca.); however, students working in pairs may share work without restriction within their pair. Getting and sharing \"hints\" from other classmates is encouraged; but, the eventual code creation work and submission must be your own individual or paired creation.\n",
